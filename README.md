**An unbalanced Balatro mod celebrating the culture of the critically acclaimed friend group, Demae Party**

## What is this?
Perhaps if you're not a part of DP, you're not going to understand half of the jokes in the mod. That's fine.

As of now, the mod contains 9 unique jokers. The mod is actively developed when we feel like it.

Works best with a morbillion other mods for the full gamblecore experience.

## Requirements

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and the latest version of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) **(Version 1.0.0~ALPHA-1225a or later)**. Without these dependencies, this mod will not function.  
This mod also requires basic reading ability. Not all that's shining is gold. In fact, a wrong joker may ruin your run.

## Contributions

We do not want your joker ideas. It would ruin the point of the mod - made mostly of things the said friend group laughs at (that is, unless, you are part of us; you are welcome to do so!  
Otherwise? You can check if this mod doesn't conflict with others and report issues.
